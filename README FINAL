Hello, welcome to our project!

Our notebooks for this project can be found in Anila.ipynb and Student.ipynb

We started by cleaning the data and performing an EDA - Student.ipynb and Anila.ipynb first sections
  
  We discarded nulls, and any symbols within the columns that were not appropriate
  We converted floats to integers for more fluid transformations where appropriate
  We added dummies to the categorical data to be able to run regressions further down the line

We then began to analyse and describe the data - second section in notebooks
  
  We looked at the price distribution of houses in King County
  We also looked at the price distribution by geography within the county with an interactive heatmap

We then took a closer look at the feature variables and how they are distributed - third section

  In this section we also assessed the multicollinearity between the variables and experimented with looking at homo/heteroscedacity

Now we move on to build the first baseline model

  We construct the train/test split that we will use throughout the modelling
  We create a model using all the features from our dataset
  
Now we refine the model

  First refinement: we drop features with insignificant p-values (more than 0.05)
    Test model
    
  Second refinement: we drop features that have a variance inflation factor of greater than 10 (display a lot of multicollinearity)
    Test model
    
Now we build another, bottom-up model:

  We select features known to predict house prices with a strong degree of accuracy and taking into account 
  multicollinearity and p-values calculated above.
  
  We also check the normality and heteroscedastic assumptions
  
Now we build another model that drops outliers in house price
  
  We dropped prices past the 0.99 quintile however this negatively affected our r-squared in the end and we decided to use
  the full data-set
  
  We checked for normality in the outlier dropped model and this showed an improvement in normality however
  the score took too large a hit to continue with
  
We finally ran our original, refined model on our test data and our score showed no overfitting!
  
  We described three of our coefficients at the end of the student.ipynb notebook
